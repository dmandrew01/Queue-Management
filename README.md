# Queue Management (Incident Response)

## Objective
Simulated real SOC analyst work by triaging a live queue of alerts with varying severity. Resolved one medium, one high, and one critical incident by following structured investigation and containment procedures.

### Skills Learned
- Prioritization of incidents based on criticality (Critical → High → Medium).
- Hands-on containment and eradication processes.
- Experience documenting root cause analysis and remediation steps.
- Deepened knowledge of CVE exploitation, malware execution, and zero-day attack handling.

### Tools Used
- LetsDefend Monitoring Queue.
- SIEM log correlation and analysis.
- EDR/Defender for endpoint containment.
- Vulnerability advisories for CVEs (Palo Alto, Check Point).
